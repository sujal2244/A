# NextJs Example

This is a simple example of nextjs with react and tailwindcss. you can use this as a starting point for your own project.

First you need to setup the NextJs project.
You can refer to NextJs documentation for that: https://nextjs.org/docs

This package supports all the latest version of NextJs.

After setting up, install the upiqr package using npm:

```bash
npm i @omkarbhosale/upiqr
```

After installation, you can now make a custome component for generating UPI QR code in your NextJs project.

```js
// app/components/Qrcode.jsx

"use client";

import { useState, useEffect } from "react";
import Image from "next/image";
import generateQR from "@omkarbhosale/upiqr";

const Qrcode = ({ amount }) => {
  const [qrCode, setQrCode] = useState(null);
  const [error, setError] = useState(null);

  console.log(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_UPI_ID);  // Save your UPI ID in .env file and check on the client console if it is working!

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchQRCode = async () => {
      try {
        // Generate the QR code as a Base64 URL
        const data = await generateQR({
          UPI_ID: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_UPI_ID,
          AMOUNT: amount,
        });
        setQrCode(data);
      } catch (error) {
        setError("Error generating QR code");
        console.error("Error generating QR code:", error);
      }
    };

    fetchQRCode();
  }, [amount]);  // QR Code will be automatically updated when amount changes.

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>UPI QR Code</h2>
      {error ? (
        <p>{error}</p>
      ) : qrCode ? (
        <Image src={qrCode} width={200} height={200} alt="QR Code image" />
      ) : (
        <p>Generating QR Code...</p>
      )}
    </div>
  );
};

export default Qrcode;

```

Following is a full breakdown of your `Qrcode` component and how each part works:

1. Imports:
    - `useState` and `useEffect` are React hooks used for managing state and side effects.
    - `Image` component from the Next.js Image library is used to display the generated QR code image.
    - `generateQR` is imported from your `@omkarbhosale/upiqr` package and is responsible for generating a QR code as a Base64-encoded URL.

2. Component Definition:
    - `Qrcode` is a functional component that takes two props, `upi_id` and `amount`, representing the UPI ID and the amount to include in the QR code.

3. State Variables:
    - `qrCode`: Stores the Base64 URL of the generated QR code image. Initially, it’s `null`.
    - `error`: Stores any error message if QR code generation fails. Initially, it’s `null`.

4. useEffect:
    - `useEffect` is used here to perform a side effect — fetching a QR code when the component mounts or whenever the `upi_id` or `amount` props change.
    - Dependency Array `[upi_id, amount]`: Adding `upi_id` and `amount` as dependencies ensures that `fetchQRCode` re-runs each time these props change, so if a new UPI ID or amount is passed, a new QR code is generated.

5. fetchQRCode Function:

    - Defined as an `async` function to allow the use of `awai`t for generating the QR code.
    - Try-Catch Block:
        - Inside the `try` block, `generateQR` is called with the `upi_id` and `amount` props, and the result is saved in the `data` variable.
        - The resulting `data` (Base64 URL for the QR code image) is then stored in `qrCode` using `setQrCode(data)`.
        - If an error occurs, `setError` is called to store a custom error message, and the error details are logged to the console.
